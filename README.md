# 02-First-Layout
Second project. After a coffee chat, the advice I received was to look at designs/layouts I like and try to reproduce them. The idea is to learn as I need. 

You can visit the result [here](https://hlmhc79.github.io/02-Netcel-Layout/).

The layout comes from [Ajmal khan on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/7210396-Netcel-Business-Consulting-and-Finance-Theme-Homepage-v5/attachments/202687?mode=media)

## What I learned
- Semantic HTML
- Flexbox
- Making the page responsive
- gave a try to BEM CSS naming => still a lot to read about it to get a better understanding on how to do it properly

## What I still want to learn
- @Media queries and made a page mobile first
