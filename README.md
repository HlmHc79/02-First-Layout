# 02-First-Layout
Second project. After a coffee chat, the advice I received was to look at designs/layouts I like and try to reproduce them. The idea is to learn as I need. 

You can visit it [here](https://hlmhc79.github.io/02-First-Layout/).

## What I learned
- Semantic HTML
- Flexbox
- Making the page responsive
- gave a try to BEM CSS naming => still a lot to read about it to get a better understanding on how to do it properly

## What I still want to learn
- @Media queries and made a page mobile first
